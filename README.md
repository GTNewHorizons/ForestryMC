Forestry
====================================

### What is it?

This is the GTNH fork of Forestry for 1.7.10.  Do not report any issues to the original Forestry team.  This fork is maintained by the GTNH team and is not supported by the original Forestry team.
Forestry is a modification for the game Minecraft and known primarily for its farms and bees. 


### Building

The API and localization files reside in their own repository. It is pulled in automatically.

You may want to adjust the "./gradle.properties" file to set your mc account as needed.

To setup, open a command line and run "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace" and "gradlew eclipse".

To package, open a command line and type "gradlew release".

### Notes

Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes game mechanics, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new game mechanic and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit gameplay-wise.
